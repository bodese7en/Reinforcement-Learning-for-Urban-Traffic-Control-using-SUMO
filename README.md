# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Urban-Traffic-Control-using-SUMO

## Description: This GitHub repository presents a cutting-edge implementation of reinforcement learning techniques applied to urban traffic control using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software. The project aims to optimize traffic signal control strategies in complex urban environments, addressing the ever-growing challenges of congestion, pollution, and inefficient traffic flow.

### Key Features:
1.	Reinforcement Learning Agents: The repository contains multiple reinforcement learning agents, including Q-learning, designed to learn traffic signal control policies from simulations.
2.	SUMO Integration: The implementation seamlessly integrates with SUMO, an open-source traffic simulation software. The simulator provides a realistic urban environment where the RL agents can learn and evaluate their traffic signal control strategies.
3.	Environment Setup: Comprehensive instructions and scripts are provided for setting up the traffic simulation environment, including road networks, traffic flows, and the RL agents' interfaces.
4.	Performance Metrics: Various traffic-related performance metrics, such as average travel time, queue length, and emissions, are implemented to assess the effectiveness of different RL strategies.
5.	Contribution Guidelines: Contributors are welcome to propose enhancements, submit bug fixes, and share their novel RL algorithms to further advance urban traffic control research.
6.	License: The project is released under a permissive open-source license, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the community.
### Whether you are an RL researcher, a traffic engineer, or a curious developer, this repository offers a valuable resource to explore and improve urban traffic control strategies using reinforcement learning with the powerful integration of the SUMO simulator. Join the community to shape the future of sustainable and efficient urban transportation.
